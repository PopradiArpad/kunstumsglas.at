# Website and its CMS of kunstumsglas.at

This code includes the React apps of [kunstumsglas.at](https://kunstumsglas.at) and management.kunstumsglas.at along with the server code.
The deployment details are excluded.

## About the CMS
It's capable to visualize and let edit different types of nested data in a unified way but
its visual appearance needs the right CSS yet.

## About the tests
Lots of tests are fallen out in the last rework and are not recovered yet
but I use test generally. See my contribution to the UI Framework of [elastic/kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana).
